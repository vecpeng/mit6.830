Exercise 1.

Implement the skeleton methods in:

src/java/simpledb/execution/Predicate.java

src/java/simpledb/execution/JoinPredicate.java
src/java/simpledb/execution/Filter.java
src/java/simpledb/execution/Join.java
At this point, your code should pass the unit tests in PredicateTest, JoinPredicateTest, FilterTest, and JoinTest. Furthermore, you should be able to pass the system tests FilterTest and JoinTest.
